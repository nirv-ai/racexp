## CTA - Context-Technoloy-Asides

- capture use case Specifications, requirements & acceptance criteria without hardcoding top-down requirements or having to manage-up
- CTAs should be living documents
- Participants should be responsive
- The process should be creative

### Outline

- context: the biz context; put on your CEO & forward-facing CTO hat
  - strive to provide what needs to be achieved, vs what someone needs to do
  - taking a declarative approach enables more flexibility in how downstream tasks materialize
  - the context should invoke questions of why, not questions of what
- technology: the tech context & implementation strategy; put on your inward-facing CTO & engineer hat
  - how do we achieve the goals & vision setout by the context?
  - how do we build something resilient to future (and expected) changes
- asides: additional abbreviations supporting the biz & tech context
