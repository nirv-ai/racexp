- TODOs
  - we need to to find time to finish copying stuff on paper into this readme
- racexp: three pillars of racexp
  - organizational structure: as defined by investopedia
    - system that outlines how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization
  - management methdology: as defined by teamwork
    - set of principles and practices that guide you in organizing your projects to ensure their optimum performance
  - collective intelligence: as defined by MIT
    - how people and computers can be connected so that collectively they act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before.
    - i like wikepedias definition better
      - shared or group intelligence ( GI) that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals
- competition: drivers should focus on satisfying the requirements, but also on beating the competition, which may require going beyong simple use case scenarios
- celebration: retrospectives should be reflections on how we were able to win, or next steps for winning the next race, but either way we're going to celebrate instead of complain
- funplan: a single question answerable in realtime, `are we winning or losing?`
  - winning: funstacks are (new + upgrades) / fixes > 3:1, but its really market dependent
    - perfect competition: having any fixes could spell disaster
    - competitive: any fix related to the core revenue stream could sink the ship
    - oligopoly: features provided by all competitors should never have fixes, else users will jump
    - duopoly: as long as you have less fixes than the other guy, you're practically winning
    - monopoly: it may not matter how many fixes you have until the competition leapfrogs
    - monopsony: users should never have fixes in the features they care about
  - losing: opposite of winning
    - fix: often bugs/defects will sit in a backlog because they're not/difficult to include in management/financial statistics, however canarys die slow deaths and you may not realize the oxygen levels are in the red
      - a good analogy is climate change: how many bugs exist in the system yet no one is prioritizing fixes, because the canary is still singing, but sooner or later the canary is going to fkn drop dead
  - funfacts: the proof
- [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum) Ceremonies
  - sprint planning
  - daily scrum
  - sprint review
  - retrospective
- sprints in general
  - there is no sprint, or artificial deadline every X hours, we are in a race to build the best product, and each team goes in a circle: the grid > the race > the win: just like a formula 1 race team
    - the team should know when its time for retrospective, when its time to stop and plan, and when its time to race
    - the ideal solution being:
      - when any one developer has finished a race, only a subset of their team needs to ascertain the quality of the finish and support the driver in question to prepare for their next race
        - should cycle between drivers in an `on call queue` for everyone to keep a smaller, yet more focused scope of what every other driver is doing
      - other drivers can keep their `fk u` hat on and continue to focus on the issue at hand
- RACE:XP [Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suXyQKnhs8Q)
  - Formula 1 simulators are tools used to develop drivers, improving technique, and improving the car
- Done: nothing is ever done, we're just moving the goalpost on what we're trying to achieve
  - instead: use Deployed, as we expect to bluefield everything in the future
- refactor: everything is an enhancement, even new products are refactors of someone elses idea
  - instead: use [Improvement](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/improve-increase-or-enhance-/4900905.html) and focus on the increased quality that gets us closer to the finish line, and work towards that which moves the needle most
- [Sprint](https://blogs.infosupport.com/3-reasons-for-using-sprints-and-why-they-may-be-bad/): i'll trade your predictability for adaptability any_day_of_your_sprint
  - instead:
    - embrace the complexity, risk and potential for failure.
    - Focus on change-management and short-feedback loops with immediate corrective actions
    - trend analysis: ...TODO review trading strategies and apply to racexp

# blah

uses the `race [car|team] metaphor` as the ontology of rapid prototyping/product development

- ontology

  - a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.
  - the philosophical study of being in general, or of what applies neutrally to everything that is real. It was called “first philosophy” by Aristotle in Book IV of his Metaphysics.

- ~one day I'll publish this~
- for now: the below should suffice

- TODO
- complexity of [scale and scope](https://econproph.com/2019/05/20/scale-and-scope/)
  - complexity of implementation (i.e. normal story points)
    - just because a ticket has a high story point, doesnt mean it takes a long time to complete
  - complexiity of completion (a time dimension)
    - just because a ticket takes a long time to complete, doesnt mean its developmentally complex
  - complex solutions dont always require complex deployments, and straight forward requirements can be a pain in the ass
  - understanding the scale and scope of product reqiurements, and the scale and scope to which a developed product satisfies a customers needs, provides the two unanswerable questions in development: how difficult is this to build, and how long will it take to build it
- the RACE
  - each lane (slow, groove, fast, last lap) is the sum of implementation & completion complexity based on an individual/teams capabilities
