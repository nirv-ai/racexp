- **H**ardware (cloud/metal)
- **E**nvironment (...)
- **C**omponent (services)
- **C**ommunication (networking)
- **Y**ielding (provisioning)
- **A**rchitecture (...)

## thinking through problems

- what is the user flow for each use case?
- what is the data pipeline?
  - data sources, data serialization, data format, intermediate storage of raw data, and storage of the final transformed data
- what is the system process workflow?
  - how do system components work together in response to the user flow
- build the architecture diagram(s)
